## The next meeting will be held on TUESDAY, May 16, 2023

Our next meeting is on TUESDAY, May 16th, 2023.  It is at The Full Circle Book Coop (<https://www.fullcirclebookcoop.com/>).  It starts at 6 PM and goes until 10 PM.

This will be a casual meeting.  These meetings are for chatting with other members or getting feedback and help for that upcoming presentation you are working on.  The coop sells some alcoholic beverages (no liquor) and has some food to snack on.  It will not be only us there.

You may have noticed that it is on a TUESDAY, not a Wednesday.  This is because the book coop is having a concert when we would normally have our meeting.
