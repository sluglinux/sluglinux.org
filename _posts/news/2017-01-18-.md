You may have noticed the discussion on the mailing list, if not we are
having a meeting on Wednesday, January 18th, 2017, at 6 PM in the main
meeting room at the [downtown library][1].  This is the meeting room
that is through the library not either of the two nearest the entry way.

On the mailing list Ryan Waters was kind enough to commit to presenting
a whirlwind tour of mtr, tcpdump, and wireshark.  We can also be
prepared for rhubarbpieguy to lead a discussion on GoboLinux and what he
has learned about it so far.

Other topic ideas discussed without commitment by someone to lead:

* Python environment setup
* Window managers, specifically those that are light weight and provide
  easy access to key bindings
* Wayland
* Shells other than bash that people like (e.g. zsh, dash)
* Terminal emulators other than plain old xterm
