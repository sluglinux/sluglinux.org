The next meeting will be held on January 18
===========================================

  We are having a meeting tomorrow!  However, we are going to try out a new place for this meeting.  I talked to The Full Circle Book Coop (https://www.fullcirclebookcoop.com/) and they are excited to have us use their back room for the meeting.

  Full Circle is 2 blocks south of the library where we have usually had meetings in the past.  The address is 123 W. 10th St. Sioux Falls, SD.  There are parking lots to the north and west as well as on the street.

  It isn't a terribly large room but if more people show up than fits, we can just spill out into the rest of the store.
