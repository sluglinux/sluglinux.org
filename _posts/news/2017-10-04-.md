  We have reserved the conference room in the northeast corner of the main library in downtown sioux falls (not room A or B; those are in the northwest corner next to the front doors.  same wall, just the other side of the library).  the room will be available to us starting at 6 pm untill the library closes at 9.

  See ya there, good buddy.
