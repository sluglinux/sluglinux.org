<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

The next meeting will be held at a new location, the Siouxland Libraries Main branch downtown Sioux Falls.

The idea is to have plenty of topics to discuss. If there is interest we can go over these topics in depth.

Some of the ideas that we have so far are:

 * [xmonad tiling window manager](http://xmonad.org/)
 * A [synergy](http://synergy-foss.org/) 3 computer, 4 monitor setup with keybindings.
 * [gitlab](http://gitlab.org/) A self hosted "github clone".
 * updating from Debian squeeze to [wheezy stable](http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/)
 * Migrating from apache to [nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main)
 * using [rdiff-backup](http://rdiff-backup.nongnu.org/) for local and remote incremental backups.
 * [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) and [screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)

What we don't get a chance to cover during this meeting can be pushed to the next meeting. You can submit your ideas to the mailing list by sending an email to sluglinux@googlegroups.com. Please check out the meeting page for more information.
