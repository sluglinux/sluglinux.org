New Meeting Schedule
====================

  There are 2 kinds of meetings now!  They rotate month-to-month!

  The primary meetings are the ones that we all know and love.  Casual meetings for just getting together and talking about technology.  Now, if someone isn't interested in attending a presentation or simply can't make it, an opportunity to collaborate in person with others in the group is only a month away.

  The primary meetings are still held at the main library in downtown Sioux Falls.  This is the space for getting everyone in one room and having presentations.  These are from 6pm to 8pm.

  The casual meetings are currently being held at the [Full Moon Book Coop](https://www.fullcirclebookcoop.com/).  These meetings are more for chatting with other participants and getting feedback and help for that upcoming presentation you are working on.  These are from 6pm to 10pm.
