Minutes

Prepared by Glenn

Alex Dean gave an overview of [DRBD](http://www.drbd.org/) and
[Heartbeat](http://linux-ha.org/wiki/Heartbeat), two high availability
tools for Linux.

DRBD is used to manage a single data set mirrored on two computers, one
computer acting as the primary server, and the other as secondary. The
computers can be in separate server farms, if desired. Heartbeat works
with DRBD to switch the secondary server to primary quickly and
automatically, if the primary server should fail.

Alex went through the configuration files for both programs, and
outlined situations in which both servers may be running, but they each
think the other host has disappeared from the network. This situation
usually occurs more frequently than the loss of a server, he said.

In the Q-and-A session that followed his talk, he outlined a number of
ways that DRBD and Heartbeat could be used with MySQL database servers.

His recommended resource for DRBD is <http://www.drbd.org/users-guide>.
The recommendations for heartbeat are

Alex works for IPS MeteoStar in Denver, CO, a company that provides high
availability solutions for weather data worldwide to government and
industry. See <http://weather.meteostar.com/> or
