* The [RPI POE](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-power-over-ethernet-poe-hat/) hat will work with the new RPI.
* "<enter>~." will kill an ssh client that has become unresponsive.
* [Quasle](https://quassel-irc.org/) is a popular chat client.  Jackson is looking for a replacement to [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/).
* suckless.org is a website some people like.
* [Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/) is an experimental Fedora project where different parts of the operating system are immutable and when an update is required, the whole immutable section is replaced.  Its goal is reliability.
* Vector made a joke about [a wife-murdering file system programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Reiser) that went over my head.
* [Btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) can be pronounced "butter f s" or "butter fuss".
* [OpenZFS](http://www.open-zfs.org/wiki/Main_Page) is no longer used by [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/).  They will be using [the Linux ZFS](https://zfsonlinux.org/) implementation.
* Vector held a flashlight under his chin and told us horror stories about moving servers around a data center.
* [QNX](https://www.qnx.com/) is a proprietary Unix-like real-time operating system that is used in cars.  It is owned by [BlackBerry](https://www.blackberry.com/).  An open-source counterpart is [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/).
* Somebody suggested printing out all your 2-factor authentication codes, keep them inside a fire-proof safe, and go through them every year to tests them out.
* [W10Privacy](https://www.w10privacy.de/english-home/) is a great tool for removing all the crap from a Windows installation.
* Install [GNOME Tweaks](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tweaks) if you don't want to hate your computer.
* [Terminology](https://www.enlightenment.org/about-terminology.md) was a terminal emulator for [Enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/) that could be highly customized with themes.  There was a theme that made the cursor into nyancat.
* [Wayfire](https://wayfire.org/) is a [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) compositor with effects like [Compiz](https://launchpad.net/compiz).
