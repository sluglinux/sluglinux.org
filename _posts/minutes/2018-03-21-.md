Minutes
=======

* It's hard to find a Linux distro for SPARC processors.
* Discussed note-taking solutions.
* Everyone learned how to pronounce ["Yggdrasil"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Yggdrasil?pronunciation&lang=en_us&dir=y&file=yggdra01).
* Some people in the group think Amazon is great for cloud computing.  Other people recommend [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Lunanode](https://www.lunanode.com/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), and [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).
* [Kubernates](https://kubernetes.io/) is cloud-computing-vender agnostic because it's container-based.  Someone mentioned containers can't be used for everything.
* Microsoft Azure's blob storage isn't as good as s3.
* Be careful of the special sauce Amazon is selling because though it tastes good, it will get you addicted and then you can't do anything when they raise their prices.
* Even in our group, not a lot of people use alternative social networks like [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/).
* [Freedom Box](https://salsa.debian.org/freedombox-team/plinth) is a beautiful dream, but right now it doesn't seems like it's going to catch on.
