We had a good meeting! Monday may be a possibility for future meetings
as it seems to work out for most of us.

We set up [synergy](http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/) on two linux
machines and found that it was WAY too easy, it didn't take long at all.

Discussed the current status of the website and the sluglinux.org
domain. Talked about a few distros, gentoo and mandrake in particular.
