Location

Siouxland Libraries Oak View Branch, Room 3 at 6:30 pm.

The room will open at 5 pm for setup.

A general help session will begin at 5:30 pm.

Agenda
======

It's open mic night at the Siouxland Linux User Group!

Tell us what you've been working on, or what Linux software you can't
live without, or maybe just what's on your mind.

There'll be plenty of time for you to tell us what new stuff you've been
discovering about GNU/Linux and free / open source software.

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
The [raspberry pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) computer was released. I
would like to hear ideas that some of us have for these.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Directions
----------

To get to the Oak View branch from the west, take Sixth Street east to
North Bahnson Ave. Turn left at the light, and drive three blocks north
to Third Street. The library is located at the northeast corner of the
intersection.

From the east, drive west from Sycamore Avenue on Third Street until you
near North Bahnson (about six blocks). The library will be on your
right.

There is no cost to attend the meeting or to join. New members are
welcome!

Minutes
=======

Still needs to have hyperlinks added.

*   Discussed a few different distros such as [Arch
    linux](http://www.archlinux.org/), [Debian](http://www.debian.org/),
    [Linux mint](http://linuxmint.com/). The new [Crunchbang
    statler](http://crunchbanglinux.org/) was demonstrated.
*   Demonstrated a few monitoring programs such as
    [htop](http://htop.sourceforge.net/) and
    [nmon](http://nmon.sourceforge.net/pmwiki.php).
*   HDDS with linux installed can be moved over from one system to
    another and still boot (for the most part, I have never seen it not
    work).
*   Vector and phliver both have [trixbox](http://fonality.com/trixbox/)
    which is based on [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/) running as
    virtual machines in linux. We discussed using spare android phones
    to make a connection to asterisk so they can be used as cordless
    VOIP phones.
*   [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) ideas
    *   [xbmc](http://xbmc.org/) frontend - [xbmc running on a Raspberry
        Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/571)
    *   hooking it up to a cell phone to do a mobile internet radio
        show. (doable with android?)
    *   car computer. (doable with android?)
    *   There are alternatives to raspberry pi
*   We discussed the [ampache](http://ampache.org/) web based music
    front end.
