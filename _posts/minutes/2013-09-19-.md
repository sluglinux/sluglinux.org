Minutes
=======

*   Next meeting is to be in January instead of December to avoid
    interfering with holiday plans.
*   We spoke a little about different filesystems such as ZFS, ext3,
    ext4, btrfs, ReiserFS and ZFS.
*   [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) was brought up as a faster implementation
    of the python interpreter.
*   It is a good time to try [LFS](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/)
    (Linux From Scratch) because recently both it and
    [BLFS](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/) had major releases,
    which doesn't often happen. This is significant because more
    packages will likely be tested.
*   [SparkleShare](http://sparkleshare.org/) is a privately hostable,
    Dropbox-like system that uses Git as the storage back-end and ssh
    for transport.
*   [Tor](http://torproject.org/)
    *   General discussion about [how Tor
        works](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#thesolution).
    *   More specific discussion about [Tor
        bridges](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en), and
        why they are useful.
*   [Cryptocat](https://crypto.cat/) was brought up, but not
    successfully demonstrated.
*   [0bin](http://0bin.net/) was brought up in discussion, it is a
    [pastebin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) that encrypts the
    paste using JavaScript and a key passed through the [fragment
    portion of the
    URL](http://blog.lunatech.com/2009/02/03/what-every-web-developer-must-know-about-url-encoding#GeneralURLsyntax).
*   [etckeeper](http://joeyh.name/code/etckeeper/)
    ([GitHub](https://github.com/joeyh/etckeeper)) came up in
    conversation, but wasn't widely used.
*   [Sabayon](http://www.sabayon.org/) came up as a distribution easier
    to get started with than [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/).
*   We watched a video for [elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/).
*   [SmartOS](http://smartos.org/) came up, but no one had used it yet.
    [OpenIndiana](http://openindiana.org/) also came up.
*   Minimal Linux distributions came up, including
    [Finnix](http://www.finnix.org/),
    [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/), and
    [CrunchBang](http://crunchbang.org/).
*   [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) was also a topic of some discussion.
    *   As was some of the [History of
        JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History).
*   Other programming related discussion included
    [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) and
    [ClojureScript](http://www.clojurescript.net/).
*   There was some [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) discussion, that segued
    into good programming practices.
*   System services and daemons were also discussed, which brought up
    [Monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/) and [M/Monit](http://mmonit.com/).
