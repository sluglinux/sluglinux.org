Minutes
=======

* Talked about Sushi-Masa, the problems of eating smart animals like octopi, and how mind-numbing commercials are.
* Neo-vim has saner defaults than regular vim.
* Jackson whipped out his vim config file and everyone gasped.
* Everyone agreed that the window manager [Unity](https://github.com/ubports/unity8) was just horrible.
* Jackson thinks [GSConnect](https://github.com/andyholmes/gnome-shell-extension-gsconnect/wiki) is great.  It syncs an Android OS and a Gnome desktop.  It allows sharing of various kinds of information between the two devices.  Things like volume control, media control, clipboard sharing, and running commands on the other machine.  It is based on [KDE Connect](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect).
* [Algo VPN](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo) is a set of Ansible scripts that simplify the setup of a personal WireGuard and IPsec VPN.
* [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand) is like Algo.
* [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) is good shit.  [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) is less good. It has had some integrations problems.
* [IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) is god-awful.
* [ClearOS](https://www.clearos.com/) used to be a VPN thing.
* [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is a fork of [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/) made by the original ownCloud developer.
* [OpenIndiana](https://www.openindiana.org/) is a fork of [OpenSolaris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris) and is terrible, according to Opello.
* Opello wants to use [ZFS](https://zfsonlinux.org/) for his network file server.
* [Oracle OS](https://www.oracle.com/linux/) is reskinned [CentOS](https://centos.org/).
* [Panorama View](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/panorama-view/) and [Snooze Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/snoozetabs/) are add-ons for Firefox that people use and enjoy.
* Jackson is a "1 percenter" for [Firefox Pocket](https://getpocket.com/about).  Pocket used to be great at text-to-speech for articles.
* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) and [1Password](https://www.lastpass.com/) are password managers.
* Someone said they bypass storing credentials on their repo by using 1Password.
* [Boto](http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest/) is a python library for AWS.
* Jackson showed us some [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) configurations.
* ssh-keyscan, part of [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) is a thing Opello uses so he doesn't have to constantly accept keys for containers.
* People who use [SaltStack](https://www.saltstack.com/) think Ansible is the devil.
