Agenda
======

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
It's open mic night at the Siouxland Linux User Group!

Tell us what you've been working on, or what Linux software you can't
live without, or maybe just what's on your mind.

There'll be plenty of time for you to tell us what new stuff you've been
discovering about GNU/Linux and free / open source software.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Directions
----------

To get to the Oak View branch from the west, take Sixth Street east to
North Bahnson Ave. Turn left at the light, and drive three blocks north

From the east, drive west from Sycamore Avenue on Third Street until you
near North Bahnson (about six blocks). The library will be on your
