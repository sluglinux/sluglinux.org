Minutes
=======

*   The usual crowd showed up. Another very informal meeting.
*   Steve handed out some comic books that were sent to us by Jeremiah
    Gray. They were GNU/Linux and Ubuntu related and geared towards
    teaching new people about GNU/Linux and Ubuntu. These are new and
    Jeremiah wanted us to give him feedback.
    *   [Hackett and Bankwell](http://www.hackettandbankwell.com/)
*   We talked a little bit about the mailing list going down and our
    move to the google groups list.
*   Discussed the direction we wanted to go in the future. Such as what
    do we want to accomplish with SLUG. What presentations we should do
    and where we should do them. How to get the word out and other
    potential meeting locations.
*   And of course various chit chat about VPNs, Asterisk, WiFi, and
    other fun things.
