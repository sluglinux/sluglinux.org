Siouxland Libraries Oak View Branch, Room 3 at 6:30 pm.

The room will open at 5 pm for setup.

A general help session will begin at 5:30 pm.

Agenda
======

It's open mic night at the Siouxland Linux User Group!

Tell us what you've been working on, or what Linux software you can't
live without, or maybe just what's on your mind.

Please feel free to add to the list of topics to discuss.

Directions
----------

To get to the Oak View branch from the west, take Sixth Street east to
North Bahnson Ave. Turn left at the light, and drive three blocks north
to Third Street. The library is located at the northeast corner of the
intersection.

From the east, drive west from Sycamore Avenue on Third Street until you
near North Bahnson (about six blocks). The library will be on your
right.

There is no cost to attend the meeting or to join. New members are
welcome!

Minutes
=======

Two new people showed up at 5:30 PM but nobody was there for general
help.

At approximately 6:30 PM, Dan and Rob arrived.

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
We fielded general questions about Linux and Open Source. Brief
discussion about [Revolution OS
(movie)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308808/).
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Dan installed Debian into a virtual machine to play with running
mozilla.org FireFox (instead of IceWeasel). We then walked through
setting up mozilla.org FireFox in `/opt` on an IBM ThinkPad T-60 running
Debian Squeeze.

We discussed various desktop environments. Rob and Dan preferred
[Fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/) for being minimal. The Debian laptop was
running [Xfce](http://www.xfce.org/).

Rob and Dan had a post-meeting discussion about Arduino and Rob's
thermostat control and home automation projects.
