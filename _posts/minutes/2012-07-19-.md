Notice
======

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
We have been having a summery cookout instead of a meeting. We should
decide if we want to have something like that again or just a regular
meeting.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

For now we will plan to just have a meeting, but should certainly
consider the social event.

I'm also not sure whether we have the library room reserved for July.

Location
========

Siouxland Libraries Oak View Branch, Room 3 at 6:30 pm.

The room will open at 5 pm for setup.

A general help session will begin at 5:30 pm.

Agenda
======

It's open mic night at the Siouxland Linux User Group!

Tell us what you've been working on, or what Linux software you can't
live without, or maybe just what's on your mind.

Please feel free to add to the list of topics to discuss.

Directions
----------

To get to the Oak View branch from the west, take Sixth Street east to
North Bahnson Ave. Turn left at the light, and drive three blocks north
to Third Street. The library is located at the northeast corner of the
intersection.

From the east, drive west from Sycamore Avenue on Third Street until you
near North Bahnson (about six blocks). The library will be on your
right.

There is no cost to attend the meeting or to join. New members are
welcome!
