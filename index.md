Welcome to the Siouxland Linux Users Group website!

The Siouxland Linux Users Group was formed to introduce new ideas, information,
and to answer questions that others may have about GNU/Linux. GNU/Linux is free
software available to you no matter what "computer level" you are on. Plus, its
all Open Source. The meetings are free for all to join, from the newbies to the
typical computer geek.

To learn more about upcoming meetings and get in touch with our members, please
visit the mailing list and the meeting information page.

For more information on what a Linux user group is you can view the [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_user_group). You
can also read the [User Group
HOWTO](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO.html).
