This meeting was at the Main Branch of the Siouxland Libraries.

Yesterday's meeting was good. Brandon Morris performed a presentation on
OpenWRT. Some of the things covered and demonstrated were:

-   Installation
-   NVRam
-   ipkg
-   Bridging

I have made the [openwrt presentation
file](Media:Meetings-2006-01-19-Openwrt.odp "wikilink") available.

Also, I highly recommend you [download your latest firmware from
openwrt.org](http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/). We used
[openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin](Media:Meetings-2006-01-19-openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin "wikilink").
